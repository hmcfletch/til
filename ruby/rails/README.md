# Rails

TIL's about the Rails framework

### Scratch

* As of Rails 4.2, `rails s` automatically binds to localhost instead of `0.0.0.0`. If you want to use [dnsmasq](https://github.com/hmcfletch/til/blob/master/utils/dnsmasq.md), ngrok, or something similar you'll need to specifically bind use `rails s -b 0.0.0.0`
